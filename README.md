## Aims and todos of this fork

This fork aims to 
* integrate with an RPI4 
* integrate with the current (2024-Q1) Raspian 64 Bookworm
* clean up configuration and code aspects that aren't neccessary any more due to progress in OS & SW libraries
* facilitates the most or at least more recent ARDUCAM python code
* fixes ardumcam.py flaws
* fixes the disturbing / blocking behaviour of fla.py when trying to control the GPIO pins for the ringlight LEDs
* adds import / export and version control abilities to the node-red code snippets (by another node-red based tool)
* extends the fla.py functionality by "stop", "reload"
